TO RECORD TRAJECTORIES CONTROLLING THE ROBOT:

1. Run the launch file with desired scenario: 
	centre_sportif
	uva_demo
	elderly_center_scenario

2. Run the keyboard teleop to be able to send controls to the robot:
	rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py

3. Run the launch file record_bag_trajs.launch (the recording node).


4. Set the desired situation:
	- Set the initial robot position in Rviz.
	- In Stage, move the people (purple blocks) to the desired positions.

5. Record the trajectory:
	- Use the tool "Publish Point" of Rviz to click on the point of the map
      that is going to be the goal for the robot.
	- A red circle will appear on the goal, and the recording will start.
      Just move the robot with the keyboard from its current position to the goal.
	- The recording will stop automatically when the robot is very close to
      the goal.
